### Description

I made some modifications from My previous entry. Fixed the output.txt problem. It was in the OCX file

Source included = OCX,DLL and Sample .EXE

DLL SOURCE INCLUDED!!!! FREE. FAST. Easy.

This is a port from Chris Yates code

(Awesome)

Make Transparent Forms using pictures. SUPER FAST AND EFFICIENT.

Now you can select the Transparent color. Example EXE to show how it is done.

No DLL Calls. Use my TransRegion ActiveX to run the TransRegion.Dll

REAL easy and it is Royalty free.

Please vote for me.
